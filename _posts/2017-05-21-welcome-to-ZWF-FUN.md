### Welcome to ZWF's GitHub Pages.

  Currently, I am working on moving my blogs from CSDN to my GitHub.

  Last two years, I have been keep blogging some problems I met in daily work, and most them are engineering type. I posted the exact methods to solve these certain problems for that there may be some engineers who are looking for the right key to making their service right. In those articles, I told readers how to fix things instead of telling them why we fix in that way. And in the next two years, I will try to explain the theory behind the bug we have to fix.

  This is the moment which I have been expecting since my graduation, doing the job I like and working on the questions I am interested in. And so far I am still pursuing my master degree in Computational Linguistics, which is inherited from my very curiosity for the true nature of human intelligence in my undergraduate's. This time, I am gonna take it very serious.
