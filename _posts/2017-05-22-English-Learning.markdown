Today, I am gonna tell you a story about myself---how I end up with choosing coding as my career. Everything starts with my English learning. And that is definitely a long story, but very special one.

 <!--more-->
 
After a few years' coding, when I try to look back the way I came, I found that My journey is so different from a student who studies engineer or computer science. I began with Language learning, and then the theory about how to learn language, and the Linguistics, the formal language theory and automata. After that everything is no going back. I decided to think and search the true nature of human intelligence. Fortunately during the whole process, I have enough time and freedom of designing my own life, and most importantly, after so many years' school education, my curiosity still remains.

# Learning English is like boss fighting

When I was in high school, I showed nothing special about language learning or anything else. I just spent my time thinking how I can change the traditional school education and make myself less like Dead Walkers. And I believed that the school education kills one's soul, and nothing is meaningful. And I am very sure about that I hating school classes and of course English is a part of it.

After the national exam, my mayor was adjusted to English, for my score is not enough for management. And my dignity of being a science student in high school was put in the trash can. I decided to make a perfect plan of shooting English down and be able to handle all English exams within two years, so that I will have the left two year to do whatever I want, maybe have some romantic time with a girl or some.

Here is the plan:

-----
English Shooting Down Project:

-----

Objective: Be able to speak out my ideas freely in English (Daily talking)---accomplished
Time Expected: nearly 1.5 years and I am very satisfied with the result

Champion of English Reciting competition * N, Prizes for Oral English competition * N, Being consultant in English Corner,
Real promoter for dormitory's English meeting.
Study Material:

After 1.5 year's hard working, it seems that I have achieved what I wanted. Then I start reading books about everything. From philosophy to economics, from psychology to sociology, from physics to biology. That is real beginning of everything, when I read a lot of books about totally different areas, I began to realize something I've never been conscious with. I developed a habit of asking and searching the very nature about  phenomenon. I became curious about things again.

# The very nature of Language
During the study of English, I found that I am more curious about the very nature of it. And that is the point I started to take a deep look into Linguistics. My university teacher just show us a brief history of the development of the Linguistics theories. They didn't tell me what is ture nature of it, not even how they think about it. Then I have to do it by myself.

Early Stage( ---19th century):
Hand study about Language context.

Breakthrough and Development(19th century---20th century):

Ferdinand Mongin de Saussure (26 November 1857 â€“ 22 February 1913) was a Swiss linguist and semiotician. His ideas laid a foundation for many significant developments in both linguistics and semiology in the 20th century. He is widely considered one of the founders of 20th-century linguistics and one of two major founders (together with Charles Sanders Peirce) of semiotics/semiology.

Avram Noam Chomsky (born December 7, 1928) is an American linguist, philosopher, cognitive scientist, historian, social critic, and political activist. Sometimes described as "the father of modern linguistics", Chomsky is also a major figure in analytic philosophy and one of the founders of the field of cognitive science. He is Institute Professor Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he has worked since 1955, and is the author of over 100 books on topics such as linguistics, war, politics, and mass media. Ideologically, he aligns with anarcho-syndicalism and libertarian socialism.
